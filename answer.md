- Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.
  We learned about middleware and Express Routing.
- Describe Middleware?
  It's the name for functions that request and reponse objects pass through & it can mutate those objects, 
  stop the flow of those object or call for the next middeware
- Describe a Resource?
  It's a point where we all pull our data, execute CRUD operations on a resource via endpoints. Everything is a resource when building RESTful APIs. 
- What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?
  Can return 200 OK status code which means success. 
- How can we partition our application into sub-applications?
  We can use Express routers to break our applications into sub-applications(module) making it easier to maintain and nagivate.
